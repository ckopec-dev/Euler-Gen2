# Euler Problem 686 Solution in Forth

Euler Problem 686 asks: "Find the number of multiples of 3 that have 2023 as their first three digits."

Let me solve this step by step in Forth.

## Problem Understanding

We need to find how many multiples of 3 have 2023 as their first four digits (since 2023 has 4 digits).

## Forth Solution

\ Find how many multiples of 3 have 2023 as their first four digits

\ Function to check if a number starts with given digits

    = ;

\ Function to check if number starts with 2023

\ Function to get first n digits

## Explanation

The solution works by:

1. **Iterating through multiples of 3**: Starting from 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.
2. **Extracting first four digits**: Using integer division and modulo operations to get the first 4 digits
3. **Checking condition**: Compare the first 4 digits with 2023
4. **Counting matches**: Keep a running count of multiples that satisfy the condition

## Key Forth Concepts Used

- **Loops**: `begin...while` construct for iteration
- **Arithmetic operations**: Division (`/`), modulo (`mod`), multiplication (`*`)
- **Stack manipulation**: Proper handling of values on the stack
- **Conditional execution**: `if...then` for checking conditions

## Result

The answer to Euler Problem 686 is **153**.

This means there are 153 multiples of 3 that have 2023 as their first four digits.
