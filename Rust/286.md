# Euler Problem 286 Solution in Rust

Let me solve this step by step.

## Problem Understanding

Euler Problem 286 asks: "An isosceles triangle has a base of length 10 and an area of 30. What is the length of the two equal sides?"

Let me denote:
- Base = 10
- Area = 30
- Equal sides = s (what we want to find)

## Mathematical Approach

For an isosceles triangle with base b and equal sides s, we can use the formula for area:
Area = (1/2) × base × height

First, I'll find the height using the area:
30 = (1/2) × 10 × height
height = 6

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem on half of the triangle:
- The base is split into two equal parts of 5 each
- Height = 6
- The equal side s is the hypotenuse

s² = 5² + 6²
s² = 25 + 36
s² = 61
s = √61

## Rust Implementation

```rust
fn main() {
    // Given values
    let base = 10.0;
    let area = 30.0;
    
    // Calculate height using area = (1/2) * base * height
    let height = (2.0 * area) / base;
    
    // Half of the base
    let half_base = base / 2.0;
    
    // Using Pythagorean theorem to find the equal sides
    // s² = (base/2)² + height²
    let side_squared = half_base * half_base + height * height;
    let side = side_squared.sqrt();
    
    println!("The length of the equal sides is: {:.10}", side);
    println!("Verification: {:.10}", side);
    
    // For verification, let's check that we get the right area
    let calculated_area = 0.5 * base * height;
    println!("Calculated area: {:.10}", calculated_area);
}
```

## Alternative Approach with Exact Calculation

```rust
fn solve_euler_286() -> f64 {
    // Base of the isosceles triangle
    let base = 10.0;
    
    // Area of the triangle
    let area = 30.0;
    
    // Calculate height from area = (1/2) * base * height
    let height = 2.0 * area / base;
    
    // Half of the base
    let half_base = base / 2.0;
    
    // Using Pythagorean theorem: s² = (base/2)² + height²
    let side_squared = half_base * half_base + height * height;
    
    // Return the length of equal sides
    side_squared.sqrt()
}

fn main() {
    let result = solve_euler_286();
    println!("The length of the equal sides is: {:.10}", result);
    println!("This equals √61 ≈ {:.10}", 61.0_f64.sqrt());
}
```

## Final Answer

The length of the two equal sides is **√61** or approximately **7.8102496759**.

The mathematical solution:
1. From area = (1/2) × base × height: height = 6
2. Using Pythagorean theorem: s² = 5² + 6² = 25 + 36 = 61
3. Therefore: s = √61

This is the exact answer to Euler Problem 286.
