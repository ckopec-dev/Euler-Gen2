# Euler Problem 3 Solution in Ada

Euler Problem 3 asks: "What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?"

Here's the Ada solution:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO; use Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Largest_Prime_Factor is
   Number : constant Long_Long_Integer := 600851475143;
   Factor : Long_Long_Integer := 2;
   Largest_Factor : Long_Long_Integer := 1;
   
begin
   while Factor * Factor <= Number loop
      if Number mod Factor = 0 then
         Largest_Factor := Factor;
         while Number mod Factor = 0 loop
            Number := Number / Factor;
         end loop;
      end if;
      Factor := Factor + 1;
   end loop;
   
   if Number > 1 then
      Largest_Factor := Number;
   end if;
   
   Put("The largest prime factor is: ");
   Put(Largest_Factor);
   New_Line;
end Largest_Prime_Factor;
```

## Explanation

This solution works by:

1. Starting with the smallest prime factor (2)
2. Continuously dividing the number by each factor found
3. Keeping track of the largest factor encountered
4. Only checking factors up to the square root of the remaining number
5. If there's a remainder greater than 1 after factorization, that remainder is the largest prime factor

## Key Features

- Uses `Long_Long_Integer` to handle the large number (600851475143)
- Efficient algorithm that only checks up to √n
- Handles the case where the remaining number after factorization is itself prime
- Clean, readable Ada code with proper variable declarations

## Output
```
The largest prime factor is: 6857
```

The answer is **6857**, which is the largest prime factor of 600851475143.
