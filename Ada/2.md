# Euler Problem 2 Solution in Ada

## Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Euler_2 is
   Limit : constant := 4_000_000;
   Sum   : Integer := 0;
   Term1 : Integer := 1;
   Term2 : Integer := 2;
   Temp  : Integer;
begin
   -- Loop through Fibonacci sequence
   while Term2 <= Limit loop
      -- Add even terms to sum
      if Term2 mod 2 = 0 then
         Sum := Sum + Term2;
      end if;
      
      -- Generate next Fibonacci number
      Temp := Term1 + Term2;
      Term1 := Term2;
      Term2 := Temp;
   end loop;
   
   Put_Line("Sum of even Fibonacci terms: " & Integer'Image(Sum));
end Euler_2;
```

## Explanation

This solution uses an iterative approach to generate Fibonacci numbers:

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 2)
2. **Loop**: Continue generating Fibonacci numbers while they don't exceed 4 million
3. **Even Check**: For each Fibonacci number, check if it's even using the modulo operator
4. **Accumulation**: Add even numbers to the running sum
5. **Generation**: Calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two

## Key Features

- **Efficient**: Uses O(1) space and O(n) time complexity
- **Clear**: Well-commented code that follows Ada conventions
- **Correct**: Handles the Fibonacci sequence generation properly
- **Readable**: Uses meaningful variable names and proper formatting

## Output
When executed, the program will output:
```
Sum of even Fibonacci terms: 4613732
```
