# Euler Problem 9 Solution in Ada

Euler Problem 9 asks: "There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc."

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which a² + b² = c².

## Solution

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Euler_009 is
   Target_Sum : constant := 1000;
   Product    : Integer;
   Found      : Boolean := False;
begin
   -- Iterate through possible values of a and b
   for a in 1 .. Target_Sum / 3 loop
      for b in (a + 1) .. (Target_Sum - a) / 2 loop
         -- Calculate c from the constraint a + b + c = 1000
         declare
            c : constant Integer := Target_Sum - a - b;
         begin
            -- Check if it forms a Pythagorean triplet
            if a * a + b * b = c * c then
               Product := a * b * c;
               Put_Line("Triplet found: a=" & Integer'Image(a) &
                        ", b=" & Integer'Image(b) &
                        ", c=" & Integer'Image(c));
               Put_Line("Product abc = " & Integer'Image(Product));
               Found := True;
               exit;
            end if;
         end;
      end loop;
      
      exit when Found;
   end loop;
   
   if not Found then
      Put_Line("No triplet found");
   end if;
end Euler_009;
```

## Explanation

The solution works by:

1. **Iterating through possible values**: Since a < b < c and a + b + c = 1000, we know:
   - a must be less than 1000/3 (since if a ≥ 334, then b and c would be even larger)
   - For each a, b must be greater than a and less than (1000-a)/2

2. **Calculating c**: From the constraint a + b + c = 1000, we get c = 1000 - a - b

3. **Checking the Pythagorean condition**: Verify that a² + b² = c²

4. **Early termination**: Once we find the triplet, we exit immediately since the problem states there's exactly one solution

## Key Optimizations

- **Bounds calculation**: We limit the search space by calculating the maximum possible values for b and c
- **Early exit**: As soon as we find the solution, we stop searching
- **Efficient iteration**: We iterate through a and b in a way that naturally maintains a < b < c

## Output
The program will output:
```
Triplet found: a= 200, b= 375, c= 425
Product abc = 31875000
```

Therefore, the product abc = **31,875,000**.
