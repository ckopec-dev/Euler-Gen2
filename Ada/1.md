# Euler Problem 1 in Ada

## Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution in Ada

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Euler_1 is
   Sum : Integer := 0;
   Limit : constant Integer := 1000;
begin
   for I in 1 .. Limit - 1 loop
      if (I mod 3 = 0) or (I mod 5 = 0) then
         Sum := Sum + I;
      end if;
   end loop;
   
   Put_Line("The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is:");
   Put_Line(Integer'Image(Sum));
end Euler_1;
```

## Explanation

This Ada program solves the problem by:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `Sum` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total
   - `Limit` is set to 1000 as specified in the problem

2. **Loop through numbers**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to 999 (since we want numbers below 1000)
   - For each number `I`, we check if it's divisible by 3 OR 5

3. **Condition check**:
   - `I mod 3 = 0` checks if `I` is divisible by 3
   - `I mod 5 = 0` checks if `I` is divisible by 5
   - The `or` operator ensures numbers divisible by either (or both) are included

4. **Accumulation**:
   - If the condition is true, the number is added to `Sum`

5. **Output**:
   - The final result is displayed using `Put_Line`

## Expected Output
```
The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is:
233168
```

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this Ada program:
```bash
gnatmake euler_1.adb
./euler_1
```

The solution uses basic Ada constructs including loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations to efficiently compute the answer to Project Euler Problem 1.
