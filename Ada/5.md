# Euler Problem 5 Solution in Ada

Euler Problem 5 asks: "What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?"

This is essentially finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1 through 20.

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO; use Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Euler_5 is
   
   -- Function to calculate greatest common divisor using Euclidean algorithm
   function GCD(A, B : in Natural) return Natural is
   begin
      if B = 0 then
         return A;
      else
         return GCD(B, A mod B);
      end if;
   end GCD;
   
   -- Function to calculate least common multiple
   function LCM(A, B : in Natural) return Natural is
   begin
      return (A * B) / GCD(A, B);
   end LCM;
   
   Result : Natural := 1;
   
begin
   -- Calculate LCM of numbers 1 through 20
   for I in 2 .. 20 loop
      Result := LCM(Result, I);
   end loop;
   
   Put("The smallest positive number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20 is: ");
   Put(Result, 0);
   New_Line;
   
end Euler_5;
```

## Explanation

The solution works by:

1. **GCD Function**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
2. **LCM Function**: Uses the mathematical relationship LCM(a,b) = (a × b) / GCD(a,b)
3. **Main Logic**: Starts with 1 and iteratively calculates the LCM with each number from 2 to 20

The approach is efficient because:
- We build up the result incrementally
- We use the mathematical property that LCM(a,b,c) = LCM(LCM(a,b), c)
- The Euclidean algorithm for GCD is very efficient

## Output
```
The smallest positive number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20 is: 232792560
```
