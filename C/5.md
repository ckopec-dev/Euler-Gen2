# Euler Problem 5 Solution in C

Euler Problem 5 asks: "What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?"

This is essentially finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1 through 20.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to calculate Greatest Common Divisor using Euclidean algorithm
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

// Function to calculate Least Common Multiple
int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b;
}

int main() {
    int result = 1;
    
    // Calculate LCM of numbers 1 to 20
    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
        result = lcm(result, i);
    }
    
    printf("The smallest positive number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20 is: %d\n", result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation:

1. **GCD Function**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor
2. **LCM Function**: Uses the relationship LCM(a,b) = (a × b) / GCD(a,b)
3. **Main Logic**: Iteratively calculates the LCM of the current result with each number from 1 to 20

## Output:
```
The smallest positive number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20 is: 232792560
```

The solution works by recognizing that we need the LCM of all numbers from 1 to 20, and we can compute this incrementally by finding the LCM of the running result with each subsequent number.
