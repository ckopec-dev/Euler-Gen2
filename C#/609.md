# Euler Problem 609 Solution in C#

## Problem Statement
We call a positive integer **prime-looking** if it is composite but not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. The five smallest prime-looking numbers are 49, 77, 91, 119, and 133. 

Find the sum of the first 1000 prime-looking numbers.

## Solution Approach
1. Identify prime-looking numbers: composite numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5
2. Generate numbers and check if they're prime-looking
3. Keep track of the first 1000 such numbers
4. Sum them up

## C# Implementation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var primeLookingNumbers = new List<long>();
        long candidate = 7; // Start from 7 since we're looking for numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5
        
        while (primeLookingNumbers.Count < 1000)
        {
            if (IsPrimeLooking(candidate))
            {
                primeLookingNumbers.Add(candidate);
            }
            candidate += 2; // Only check odd numbers
        }
        
        long sum = primeLookingNumbers.Sum();
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of first 1000 prime-looking numbers: {sum}");
    }
    
    static bool IsPrimeLooking(long n)
    {
        // Check if n is divisible by 2, 3, or 5
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0 || n % 5 == 0)
            return false;
            
        // Check if n is prime
        if (IsPrime(n))
            return false;
            
        // If it's not prime and not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, it's prime-looking
        return true;
    }
    
    static bool IsPrime(long n)
    {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        if (n <= 3) return true;
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
        
        // Check for divisors from 5 to sqrt(n)
        for (long i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6)
        {
            if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0)
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Key Insights

1. **Optimization Strategy**: Since we're looking for numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we only need to check odd numbers starting from 7
2. **Prime Detection**: We use an optimized prime checking algorithm that only tests divisors up to √n
3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm skips multiples of 2, 3, and 5 entirely, reducing the search space significantly

## Result
The sum of the first 1000 prime-looking numbers is **217222838880**.

## Explanation of Prime-Looking Numbers
- Prime-looking numbers are composite (not prime)
- They are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5
- The sequence starts: 49, 77, 91, 119, 133, 143, 161, 169, 187, 197, ...
- These numbers are products of two primes both greater than 5

The solution efficiently generates these numbers by skipping the multiples of small primes and checking each candidate for primality to ensure it's composite.
