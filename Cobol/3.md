## Explanation

This COBOL program solves Euler Problem 3 by:

1. **Initialization**: Sets the target number (600851475143) and starts with factor 2
2. **Main Loop**: Continues factoring until we've processed all possible factors
3. **Factor Testing**: For each potential factor:
   - Divides the number by the current factor
   - If no remainder, this is a prime factor
   - Updates the largest factor found
   - Divides the number by this factor
   - Moves to the next potential factor (skipping even numbers after 2)
4. **Output**: Displays the largest prime factor found

## Key Features

- Uses 12-digit numeric fields to handle the large number
- Implements efficient factorization by only testing odd numbers after 2
- Continues until the square root of the number is reached
- Handles the special case of factor 2 separately

## Expected Output

```
Largest prime factor is: 6857
```

This solution efficiently finds that 6857 is the largest prime factor of 600851475143.
