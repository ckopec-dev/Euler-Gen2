# Euler Problem 324 Solution in Go

Let me solve this step by step.

First, let me understand what Euler Problem 324 asks:
- Find the number of ways to tile a 3×n rectangle with 2×1 dominoes
- The dominoes can be placed horizontally or vertically
- Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. Let me think about the approach:

## Approach

I'll use dynamic programming where I consider the state of each column and
