# Euler Problem 30 Solution in Go

## Problem Statement
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
- 1634 = 1⁴ + 6⁴ + 3⁴ + 4⁴
- 8208 = 8⁴ + 2⁴ + 0⁴ + 8⁴
- 9474 = 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴

As 1 = 1⁴ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

## Solution

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func sumOfFifthPowers(n int) int {
    sum := 0
    for n > 0 {
        digit := n % 10
        sum += int(math.Pow(float64(digit), 5))
        n /= 10
    }
    return sum
}

func main() {
    totalSum := 0
    
    // We need to find an upper bound
    // For a number with d digits, if each digit is 9, then:
    // 9^5 * d <= 10^d - 1
    // We can estimate that 6 digits is enough
    for i := 2; i < 1000000; i++ {
        if i == sumOfFifthPowers(i) {
            totalSum += i
        }
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Sum of all numbers that can be written as sum of fifth powers of their digits: %d\n", totalSum)
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Helper Function**: `sumOfFifthPowers(n int)` calculates the sum of fifth powers of all digits in number `n`
2. **Main Logic**: We iterate through numbers from 2 to 999,999 (arbitrary large number) and check if each number equals the sum of fifth powers of its digits
3. **Upper Bound Reasoning**: 
   - For a 6-digit number, the maximum sum would be 6 × 9⁵ = 6 × 59049 = 354294
   - This is less than 999999, so we don't need to check numbers beyond 6 digits
   - We start from 2 since 1¹ = 1 is not considered a sum

## Output
```
Sum of all numbers that can be written as sum of fifth powers of their digits: 443839
```

The solution finds that the sum of all numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits is **443839**.
