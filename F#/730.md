# Euler Problem 730 Solution in F#

I'll solve Euler Problem 730, which asks for the sum of all distinct values of a specific function over a range.

## Problem Understanding

Euler Problem 730 asks us to find the sum of all distinct values of the function f(n) = n² + n + 41 for n from 0 to 1000, where we only count each distinct value once.

Let me break this down:
- We compute f(n) = n² + n + 41 for n = 0 to 1000
- We collect all distinct results
- We sum these distinct values

## F# Solution

```fsharp
let euler730 () =
    // Generate all values of f(n) = n^2 + n + 41 for n from 0 to 1000
    let values = 
        [0..1000]
        |> List.map (fun n -> n * n + n + 41)
    
    // Get distinct values and sum them
    values
    |> Set.ofList
    |> Set.sum

// Alternative more concise approach
let euler730' () =
    [0..1000]
    |> List.map (fun n -> n * n + n + 41)
    |> Set.ofList
    |> Set.sum

// Execute the solution
let result = euler730 ()
printfn "The sum of all distinct values is: %d" result
```

## Explanation

1. **Function Generation**: We create a list of all values of f(n) = n² + n + 41 for n from 0 to 1000
2. **Distinct Values**: We convert the list to a Set, which automatically removes duplicates
3. **Summation**: We sum all the distinct values using Set.sum

## Optimization Note

Since we're looking for distinct values, we could also approach this by:
- Computing values incrementally and keeping track of seen values
- But for this problem size (1001 values), the Set approach is clean and efficient

## Running the Solution

```fsharp
// To run in F# Interactive or a script:
let result = euler730 ()
printfn "Answer: %d" result
```

The solution efficiently handles the computation and returns the sum of all distinct values of the quadratic function over the specified range.
