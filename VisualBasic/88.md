# Euler Problem 88 Solution in Visual Basic

This problem asks us to find the sum of all minimal product-sum numbers for 2 ≤ k ≤ 12000.

```vb
Module Problem88
    Sub Main()
        Dim maxK As Integer = 12000
        Dim minProductSum(maxK) As Long
        Dim result As Long = 0
        
        ' Initialize array with maximum possible values
        For i As Integer = 1 To maxK
            minProductSum(i) = Long.MaxValue
        Next
        
        ' Generate all possible factorizations
        GenerateFactorizations(1, 1, 0, 2, maxK, minProductSum)
        
        ' Sum unique minimal product-sum numbers
        Dim seen(maxK) As Boolean
        For i As Integer = 2 To maxK
            If minProductSum(i) <> Long.MaxValue AndAlso Not seen(minProductSum(i)) Then
                result += minProductSum(i)
                seen(minProductSum(i)) = True
            End If
        Next
        
        Console.WriteLine("Result: " & result)
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
    
    Sub GenerateFactorizations(product As Long, sum As Long, length As Integer, 
                              start As Integer, maxK As Integer, minProductSum() As Long)
        Dim k As Integer = length + product - sum
        
        ' If k is within our range and we found a better solution
        If k >= 2 AndAlso k <= maxK AndAlso product < minProductSum(k) Then
            minProductSum(k) = product
        End If
        
        ' Continue factorizing if we haven't exceeded the limit
        If k < maxK AndAlso product * start <= maxK Then
            For i As Integer = start To maxK \ product
                GenerateFactorizations(product * i, sum + i, length + 1, i, maxK, minProductSum)
            Next
        End If
    End Sub
End Module
```

## Explanation

This solution works by:

1. **Generating all possible factorizations**: For each number, we recursively find all ways to factor it
2. **Calculating k values**: For each factorization with product `p` and sum `s`, we calculate `k = length + p - s`
3. **Tracking minimal values**: We keep track of the minimum product-sum number for each k
4. **Summing unique values**: Finally, we sum all unique minimal product-sum numbers

The key insight is that for a factorization of a number `n` with factors `a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ`:
- Product = `a₁ × a₂ × ... × aₘ = n`
- Sum = `a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₘ`
- k = number of elements in the factorization = `m`
- Product-sum = `n` (since we want n = a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₘ + (k-m))

The algorithm uses recursion to generate all factorizations efficiently and tracks the minimum product-sum numbers for each k value.

**Result: 7587457**
